#### Naming Convention for Read-Counts Data Files ####
#
# Name of read-counts data file is comprised by four parts:
# [data_name].[data_type].[data_series].tsv
# where: data_type can be either "Read-Counts" or "Experiment-Design"
#
# Read-counts and Experiment-design files are located in $DEG_DIR/Repo/Counts.
#
#
# Parameters for reading read-counts and experiment-design data files.
#
# Name conventions for read counts data files and experiment design files:
#
# [Name].[Type].[Series].[Suffix]
#
# [Name]: e.g. Read-Counts, Experiment-Design, RNA-Seq, Protein-Seq.
# [Type]: e.g. LINCS, PromoCell, IPSC.
# [Series]: e.g. series/version number, date.
# [Suffix]: e.g. tsv, R.tsv.
#
# Read-counts data files.

# A split character is used to divide column names into standard field names.
# Note: the dot (.) needs to be escaped by a backslash (\).
# Specify this parameter when experiment design schemes need to be generated
# from read counts data files.
split_char	
# The standard field names corresponding to separated parts of column names.
# Specify this parameter when experiment design schemes need to be generated
# from read counts data files.
# Note:
# In order to match column names to the pattern specified by field_names,
# generateReadCountsColumnNames.R needs to be able to split the column names
# into multiple components which can match field_names in an exact order.
# This requires the header fields of the read counts table read from
# read_counts_files can only contain legal characters suitable as the column
# names of R matrix or data.frame. Therefore, if any illegal characters are
# included in the header fields in data files, these fields cannot be matched
# with the standard fields specified by field_names.
field_names	
# field_names_positions includes column indices of specified experiment
# desgin fields in given experiment design table, in a form of:
# c(Species=1, Subject=2, State=4, Culture=7, Replicate=8, Measure=5, Sample=6, Time=3)

# This parameter must be specified for type conversion of data field.
# field_types_key for the names of data field.

# field_types_value for type of data field: character, numeric, or logical.
